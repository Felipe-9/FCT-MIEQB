- Used: TRUE
#### Common uses:
- from coatings
- adhesives
- shoe soles
- mattresses
- foam insulation
#### Timeline:
- 1937 Germany, Lverkusen: 
    - Otto Bayer and co-workers at IG Farben, discovered and patented the chemistry of polyurethanes
- 1939-1945 During world war II
    - Replacement for rubber that was expensive and hard to obtain
    - Coatings of different kinds from aeroplanes finishes to resistant clothing
- 1969 Germany, Düsseldorf:
    - Bayer exhibited an all-plastic car. Parts of this car, including the body panels, were made using a new process called reaction injection molding (RIM), in which the reactants were mixed and then injected into a mold.

- Today...
#### Caracterization
- Made of: Diisocyanates (TDI and MDI) + Polyols
- Levels of foam density:
    - Light: Use carbon dioxide as blowing agent to create the soft comfortable feel of mattress or sofa.
    - Medium: In rigid foams trapping gases such as pentane optimizes insulation properties
    - Heavy: not using blowing agents results in a dense and hardwearing consistency, can be used on rollerblade wheels
### Diisocyanates American Chemistry https://www.americanchemistry.com/industry-groups/diisocyanates-dii/diisocyanates-overview/diisocyanates-explained/
- Used: TRUE
Diisocyanates
- Dois tipos
    - TDI 2,4 - Toluene diisocyanate
        - Used primarialy in the production fo flexible foams
        - Uses:
            - Bedding and furniture, 
            - carpet underlay, 
            - packaging applications,
            - coatings, sealants, adhesives and elastomers.
            - transportation applcations: used to make lighter automobile parts => higher fuel energy/energy conservation.
    - MDI 4,4' - Diphenylmethane Diisocyanate
        - Two forms: pure MDI and polymeric MDI (PMDI)
        - Pure MDI uses: Coatings, Adhesives, sealants and elastomeres (CASE) such as paints, glues and wheather resistant materials.
        - PMDI uses: rigid, flexibles, semi-rigid and polyisocyanyrate and thermoset foams.
        - Uses: rigid foams used for home and refrigerator insulation => Conserve energy
