\begin{sectionBox}1{Batch Growth} % S1
      
  When cells are grown in batch culture, \emph{several phases} of cell growth are observed.
  The different phases of growth are more \emph{readily distinguished} when the \emph{logarithm of viable cell concentration is plotted against time}

\begin{sectionBox}*2{Growth rate} % S1.0.1
  The cell growth rate (\(r_X\)) measures the change in volumetric concentration of viable cells (\(\unitof{( x )}=\unit{\gram/\metre^3}\))
  \begin{BM}
    r_X = \odv{x}{t} = \mu\,x
    \implies 
    \adif{\ln{x}}
    = \mu\,t

    \\    \dim{x}=M/L^3
    \quad\dim{\mu=T^{-1}}
  \end{BM}

  \paragraph{Doubling time \(t_d\)}
  Cell growth rates are often expressed in terms of the time it takes to duplicate the population.
  \begin{BM}
    x=2\,x_0 : t=t_d = \frac{\log{2}}{\mu}
  \end{BM}

\begin{sectionBox}1{Balanced Growth} % S2
  In an environment favourable for growth, cells regulate their metabolism and adjust the rates of various internal reactions so that a condition of balanced growth occurs. During balanced growth, \emph{the composition of the biomass remains constant}. For the biomass composition to remain constant during growth, the specific rate of production of each component in the culture must be equal to the cell specific growth rate \(\mu\).\\
  In most cultures, balanced growth occurs at the same time as exponential growth.
  \begin{BM}
    r_P = \mu\,p
  \end{BM}
  Another point is that the cell consumption is also constant
  \begin{BM}
    \odv{x}{t}=r_X
  \end{BM}
\end{sectionBox}

\begin{sectionBox}1{Effect of Substrate Concentration} % S3
  \emph{During the growth and decline phases of batch culture}, the specific growth rate of the cells depends on the concentration of nutrientes in the medium.\\[1ex]
  Often a \emph{single substrate} exerts a \emph{dominant influence on the rate of growth}; this component is know as the \emph{growth-rate-limiting substrate (\textit{S})}.\\[1ex]
  During balanced growth, the specific growth rate is related to the concentration of the growth limiting substrate by a homologue of the \textit{Michaelis--Menten} expresion, the \emph{Monod equation:}
  \begin{BM}
    \mu 
    = \frac
    {\mu_{\max{}}\,s}
    {K_S+s}
    = \frac
    {\mu_{\max{}}}
    {1+K_S/s}
    \\
    \unitof{(s)} = \unit{\frac{\gram\of{S}}{\litre}}
  \end{BM}
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth]{monadEquationGraph.png}
    % Annotation: s=K_S => \mu = \mu_{max}/2
  \end{center}

  \subsection*{Rate behavious based on concentration of substrate}

  if \(\mu\) is dependent on the substrate concentration as indicated by the Monod equation, how can \(\mu\) remain constant during the growth phase? Typical values for the substrate constant (\(K_S\)) are very small in order of \unit{\mg/\L} for carbonhydrate substrates and \unit{\micro\g/\litre} for other compounds such as aminoacids.\\

  The behaviour of specific growth rate (\(\mu\)) with the concentration of substrate in relation to the substrate constant \(K_S\) follows:
  \begin{center}
    \vspace{1ex}
    \begin{tabular}{l L @{} L @{\(\implies\)} L}
      \toprule

        Growth        & s\gtrsim  &  K_S\,10             & \mu\approx\mu_{\max}
      \\ Decline Start & s\in      &  K_S *\myrange{10,1} & \mu = \mu_{\max}/(1+K_S/s)
      \\ Decline       & s\approx  &  K_S                 & \mu \approx \mu_{\max{}}/2
      \\ Decline End   & s <       &  K_S                 & \mu = \mu_{\max{}}/(1+K_S/s)
      \\ Statinoary    & s\ll      &  K_S                 & \mu \approx 0

      \\\bottomrule

  \subsection*{Limit of Monod equation}
  The Monod equation is by far the most frequently used expression relating to growth rate to substrate concentration. However, it is \emph{valid only for balanced growth} and should not be applied when growth conditions are changing rapidly. There are also other restrictions; for example, the Monod equations has been found to have limited applicability at \emph{extremely low substrate levels}. \emph{When growth is inhibited by high substrate or product concentrations, extra terms can be added to the Monod equation} to account for these effects.\\
  Several other kinetic expressions has been developed for cell growth these provide better correlations for experimental data in centain situations
